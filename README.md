# E-Commerce_Hive_Case_Study
With online sales gaining popularity, tech companies are exploring ways to improve their sales by analysing customer behaviour and gaining insights about product trends. Furthermore, the websites make it easier for customers to find the products they require without much scavenging.Therefore, as part of this assignment, we will be challenging you, as a big data analyst, to extract data and gather insights from a real-life data set of an e-commerce company.

One of the most popular use cases of Big Data is in eCommerce companies such as Amazon or Flipkart. So before we get into the details of the dataset, let us understand how eCommerce companies make use of these concepts to give customers product recommendations. This is done by tracking your clicks on their website and searching for patterns within them. This kind of data is called a clickstream data. The clickstream data contains all the logs as to how you navigated through the website. It also contains other details such as time spent on every page, etc.

For this assignment, you will be working with a public clickstream dataset of a cosmetics store. Using this dataset, your job is to extract valuable insights which generally data engineers come up within an e-retail company.

You are required to provide answers to the questions given below.
- Find the total revenue generated due to purchases made in October.
- Write a query to yield the total sum of purchases per month in a single output.
